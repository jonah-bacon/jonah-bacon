- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jonah Bacon. I'm currently a MS graduate student at the University of Alaska Fairbanks in the Fisheries Department.
- ğŸ‘€ My research focuses on the trophic dynamics of whitefish (Genus Corregonidae) from Prudhoe Bay and the Beaufort Sea, AK. In particular, I'm focused on 
- determining interspecific and ontogenetic differences in diet for four species.
